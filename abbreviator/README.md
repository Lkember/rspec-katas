# Abbreviator

The word "i18n" is a common abbreviation of "internationalization" the developer community use instead of typing the whole word and trying to spell it correctly. Similarly, "a11y" is an abbreviation of "accessibility".

Write a function that takes a string and turns any and all words within that string of length 4 or greater into an abbreviation following the same rules.

Notes:

- A "word" is a sequence of alphabetical characters. By this definition, if there is a hyphen (eg. "elephant-ride"), this will produce two, one on either side (eg. "elephant" and "ride").
- The abbreviated version of the word should have the first letter, then the number of removed characters, then the last letter (e.g. "e6t-r2e").
