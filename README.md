# TDD Kata with RSpec examples

A friendly place for RSpec-driven Kata to gather and teach those wanting to learn the ways of RSpec.

Send Kata requests to [e@eliotsykes.com](mailto:e@eliotsykes.com) or open an issue on the GitHub issue tracker.

I'll try screencasting if there's sufficient interest (show your interest by starring the repo or opening an issue).
